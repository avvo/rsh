.SH "NAME"
\fBrsh\fR \- Rancher SHell
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBrsh\fR [\fB\-GqTtv\fR] [\fB\-E\fR \fIlog_file\fR] [\fB\-e\fR \fIchar\fR] [\fB\-F\fR \fIconfig_file\fR] [\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR] [\fB\-l\fR \fIlogin_name\fR] [\fB\-o\fR \fIopt\fR] [\fB\-p\fR \fIport\fR] [\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR] [\fIprotocol\fR://][\fIuser\fR@]\fIhost\fR[:\fIport\fR][[/\fIenvironment\fR]/\fIstack\fR]/\fIservice\fR [\fIcommand\fR]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBrsh\fR aims to replicate the features and experience of ssh, but for docker containers running within Rancher, as such it is a program for connecting into a remote container and for executing commands on a remote container\.
.
.P
\fBrsh\fR queries the Rancher API at \fIhost\fR to find a container within the specified \fIenvironment\fR, \fIstack\fR, and \fIservice\fR then connects to the first available container\.
.
.P
If \fIcommand\fR is specified, it is executed on the remote host instead of a login shell\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR \fIlog_file\fR
Append debug logs to \fIlog_file\fR instead of standard error\.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR \fIchar\fR
Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default: \'~\')\. The escape character is only recognised at the beginning of a line\. The escape character followed by a dot (\'\.\') closes the connection; followed by control\-Z suspends the connection; and followed by itself sends the escape character once\. Setting the character to "none" disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fIconfig_file\fR
Specifies an alternative per\-user configuration file\. If a configuration file is given on the command line, the system\-wide configuration file (\fI/etc/rsh/rsh_config\fR) will be ignored\. The default for the per\-user configuration file is \fI~/\.rsh/config\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR
Causes \fBrsh\fR to print its configuration after evaluating Host blocks and exit\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Causes \fBrsh\fR to print a short help message and exit\.
.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fIlogin_name\fR
Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine\. This also may be specified on a per\-host basis in the configuration file\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR \fIopt\fR
Can be used to give options in the format used in the configuration file\. This is useful for specifying options for which there is no separate command\-line flag\. For full details of the options listed below, and their possible values, see rsh_config(5)\.

.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIport\fR
Port to connect to on the remote host\. This can be specified on a per\-host basis in the configuration file\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
Quiet mode\. Causes most warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR
Disable pseudo\-terminal allocation\.
.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
Force pseudo\-terminal allocation\. This can be useful when executing a shell or console program directly, rather than performing a login\. Multiple \fB\-t\fR options force tty allocation, even if rsh has no local tty\.
.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display the version number and exit\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose mode\. Causes \fBrsh\fR to print debugging messages about its progress\. This is helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems\. Multiple \fB\-v\fR options increase the verbosity\. The maximum is 3\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Start a login shell as the \fIroot\fR user on a container in the \fIapi\fR service of the \fIweb\fR stack in the \fIproduction\fR environment of \fIhttps://example\.com\fR\. The current directory will be the home directory of the root user:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

rsh https://root@example\.com/production/web/api
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Execute a shell directly on a container in the \fIapi\fR service of the \fIweb\fR stack in the \fIproduction\fR environment of \fIhttps://example\.com\fR\. The user and working directory will match those configured in the service\'s Dockerfile:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

rsh \-t https://example\.com/production/web/api /bin/sh
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "AUTHENTICATION"
Upon first connecting to a Rancher server that requires authentication \fBrsh\fR will request a username and password to log into the Rancher server\. It will then create a user API key, and save this to \fI~/\.rsh/\fIhost\fR\fR, using the API key for all further requests\.
.
.P
Currently only LDAP authenticated and unauthenticated Rancher servers have been tested\.
.
.SH "ESCAPE CHARACTERS"
When a pseudo\-terminal has been requested, \fBrsh\fR supports a number of functions through the use of an escape character\.
.
.P
A single tilde character can be sent as ~~ or by following the tilde by a character other than those described below\. The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as special\. The escape character can be changed in configuration files using the \fBEscapeChar\fR configuration directive or on the command line by the \fB\-e\fR option\.
.
.P
The supported escapes (assuming the default \'~\') are:
.
.TP
\fB~\.\fR
Disconnect\.
.
.TP
\fB~^Z\fR
Background rsh\.
.
.TP
\fB~?\fR
Display a list of escape characters\.
.
.TP
\fB~V\fR
Decrease the verbosity (\fBLogLevel\fR) when errors are being written to stderr\.
.
.TP
\fB~v\fR
Increase the verbosity (\fBLogLevel\fR) when errors are being written to stderr\.
.
.SH "FILES"
.
.TP
\fB~/\.rsh/\fR
This directory is the default location for all user\-specific configuration and authentication information\.
.
.TP
\fB~/\.rsh/config\fR
This is the per\-user configuration file\. The file format and configuration options are described in rsh_config(5)\.
.
.TP
\fB/etc/rsh/rsh_config\fR
Systemwide configuration file\. The file format and configuration options are described in rsh_config(5)\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
\fBrsh\fR will normally set the following environment variables:
.
.TP
\fBTERM\fR
Set to the value of \fBTERM\fR on the client machine\.
.
.P
Additional environment variables can be forwarded by setting the \fBSendEnv\fR option in rsh_config(5)\.
.
.SH "AUTHORS"
\fBavvoenv\fR is heavily inspired by OpenSSH, and portions of the man page have been directly copied\. It is written and maintained by the Avvo Infrastructure Team \fIinfrastructure@avvo\.com\fR\.
